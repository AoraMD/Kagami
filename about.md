> The repository is forked from Kamikat's Kagami Jekyll theme.
>
> This readme document will only contain descriptions of new features compared to the origin. Please see [the origin repository](https://github.com/kamikat/jekyll-theme-kagami) for more details about Kagami.
>
> The original repository was low maintenance that it is difficult to quickly merge new features into it, so I forked this repository.

Simple and clean theme for Jekyll and GitHub Pages.
